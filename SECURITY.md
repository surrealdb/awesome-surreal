## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SurrealDB code, software, and cloud platform very 
seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in 
SurrealDB, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate 
all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report any issues or vulnerabilities to security@surrealdb.com, 
instead of posting a public issue in GitHub. Please include the version 
identifier, by running `surrealdb version` on the command-line, and 
details on how the vulnerability can be exploited.
